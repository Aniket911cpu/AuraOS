**Aura OS** (formerly *Project AETHER*) is a next-generation "Post-Modern Cognitive Operating System" designed for the 2025 power user. It rejects the stagnant flat-design paradigms of the past decade in favor of **"Ethereal Permanence"**—a user experience where digital objects have weight, optical density, and fluid presence.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Liquid Glass Visuals
The UI is not painted; it is rendered. Windows are 3D objects made of virtual glass with refractive indices, thickness, and mass.
- **Refraction**: Backgrounds distort physically behind active windows.
- **Chronometric Light**: A global "Sun" renders cohesive shadows and color temperatures based on your local time (Cool Blue at dawn, Warm Gold at sunset).
- **Infinite Z-Axis**: Windows don't just layer; they elevate. Active items float up and catch the light; inactive items recede and frost over.

### 2. The Cognitive Kernel
AI is not a chatbot sidecar; it is the system bus.
- **Context Orb**: A multimodal intent interface replacing the Start Menu. Drag *anything* to it to trigger action.
- **Semantic Filesystem**: Retrieve files by "vibe" or description ("The jazz playlist I made last Tuesday"), not just path.

### 3. Immutable Foundation
- **Rust Kernel**: Memory-safe, crash-proof, and atomic.
- **Bottle Containers**: Every legacy application runs in a hermetically sealed "Bottle" (containerized Wine prefix), preventing system rot.

## Architecture
