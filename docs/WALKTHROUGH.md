# Aura OS: User Walkthrough

Welcome to **Aura OS**. This guide will help you navigate the "Post-Modern" interface.

## 1. The Context Orb (Start Menu Reimagined)
Instead of a list of apps, you have the **Orb**.
- **Location**: Floats at the bottom center of your screen.
- **Interaction**:
    - **Click**: Opens the "Intent Bar" to type commands naturally (e.g., "Open the file I was working on yesterday").
    - **Drag & Drop**: Drag *any* file, text, or image onto the Orb. The **Cognitive Kernel** will analyze it and suggest actions (e.g., drag a PDF -> "Summarize", "Email", "Sign").

## 2. The Bento Grid (Window Management)
Windows in Aura OS don't scatter; they snap.
- **Magnetic Locking**: Drag a window near another, and it will snap into a grid cell.
- **Reflow**: Resizing one window automatically adjusts its neighbors, like a masonry layout.
- **Cell Clusters**: Group related apps (e.g., "Work Mode") into a single draggable cluster.

## 3. Visuals: Physicality & Light
- **Depth**: Active windows rise physically (Infinite Z-Axis). Inactive windows recede and blur.
- **Light**: Notice the shadows? They move. The "Chronometric Light" syncs with your real-world time.
    - **Morning**: Cool, sharp light from the East.
    - **Evening**: Warm, long shadows from the West.

## 4. Bottle Containers (Legacy Apps)
Running a Windows app?
- It runs inside a **Bottle** (a contained environment).
- It will have a special "Liquid Glass" border to match the OS aesthetics.
- Files saved in a Bottle are isolated unless you explicitly export them.
